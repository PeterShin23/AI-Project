# Setup Instructions
- Install Node.js on your computer (I used v16.13.0 to set up this repo)
- Enter `npm install` into terminal - this will install the necessary dependencies (i.e. the Pok√©mon Showdown Node package)
- Run the program by running `node bot.js` in terminal (currently doesn't do anything)
